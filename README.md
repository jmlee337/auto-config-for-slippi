# Auto Config for Slippi

Auto Config's default code file just uses this one code:

```
$Default Sounds/Music 90/10 (doesn't change any other defaults) [Nicolet]
003d4a74 00000050
```

But if you want 100/0 you can use this code instead:

```
$Default Sounds/Music 100/0 (doesn't change any other defaults) [Nicolet]
003d4a74 00000064
```

You can use https://mariokartwii.com/gct/ to make your custom codefile (`GALE01.gct`) once you've gotten all the codes you want together.
